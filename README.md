#XNAGameStudio
The Education library from XNA Game Studios, valuable for MonoGame Developers for advanced samples.

The archive is now complete and all but two samples can be found here, next step MonoGaming the samples where applicable.
(The two missing are Mojapi and Racing Game as their files are too big for GIT.  I've downloaded and will source a difference host for the sample files)

If you have comments or suggestions for the archive, please let me know on twitter @SimonDarksideJ or on this site.
